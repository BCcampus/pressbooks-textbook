PressBooks Textbook adds functionality to the PressBooks plugin specific to textbooks.

== Description ==
**PressBooks Textbook** adds functionality to PressBooks to make it easier to author textbooks as well. The features it currently offers are: 
* Textbook Theme
* TinyMCE table buttons
* TinyMCE textbook buttons 
* Search functionality
* Creative Commons attribution
* Prominent admin buttons (Import, Plugin)

Textbooks have styling considerations above and beyond regular books. Open textbooks are those that are licensed with a [creative commons license](http://creativecommons.org).
This plugin was built primarily to support the creation, remixing and distribution of open textbooks for the [open textbook project in BC](http://open.bccampus.ca/about-2/).

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT! 

You must first install [PressBooks](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks). This plugin won't work without it.

= Using Git =

cd /pressbooks/wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/BCcampus/pressbooks-textbook.git 

= Then, go to the WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the Network Admin -> Plugins
2. Search for 'PressBooks Textbook'
3. Click 'Network Activate'

== Screenshots ==

1. Modified homepage
2. Search feature
3. Textbook specific buttons, styling maintain throughout export routines
4. Textbook theme

== Changelog ==

See: https://github.com/BCcampus/pressbooks-textbook/commits/master

== Updates ==

This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make this redundant.
