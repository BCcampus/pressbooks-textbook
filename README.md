PressBooks Textbook
===================

A plugin that extends PressBooks for textbook authoring.

[PressBooks](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks) is a content management and 'one button publishing' system for books.

**PressBooks Textbook** adds functionality to PressBooks to make it easier to author textbooks as well. The features it currently offers are: 
* Textbook Theme
* TinyMCE table buttons
* TinyMCE textbook buttons 
* Search functionality
* Creative Commons attribution
* Prominent admin buttons (Import, Plugin)

Primary Use Case
------------
Textbooks have styling considerations above and beyond regular books. Open textbooks are those that are licensed with a [creative commons license](http://creativecommons.org).
This plugin was built primarily to support the creation, remixing and distribution of open textbooks for the [open textbook project in BC](http://open.bccampus.ca/about-2/).
